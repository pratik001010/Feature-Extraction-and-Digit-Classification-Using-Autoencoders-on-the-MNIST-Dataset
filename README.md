# Feature-Extraction-and-Digit-Classification-Using-Autoencoders-on-the-MNIST-Dataset
Implements an autoencoder-based approach for MNIST digit recognition. The model learns a compact 32-dimensional latent representation for feature extraction and uses it to classify digits efficiently. Demonstrates unsupervised learning, t-SNE visualization, and high classification accuracy.
